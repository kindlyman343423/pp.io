      <h1 class="title">Decentralized Storage Network Comparision</h1>
      <p>Society is transitioning from the industrial age to the information age, and data is becoming one of the world’s most valuable resources.​ But centralized servers containing sensitive information are targets for hackers. Even the best tech companies cannot protect themselves; case in point data breaches from Dropbox, Verizon, and Google. Censorship is the other critic centralized servers are facing. Companies sell private information to advertisers and even hand it over to the government and law enforcement.</p>
      <p>DDecentralized storage creates the opportunity to solve these problems. Coupled with the blockchain, users can securely store files while providing fast and affordable access. There are many players trying to compete in this area. PPIO decentralized storage is one of them. It is a decentralized storage and delivery network that draws on the blockchain and P2P technology for an effective and secure platform. But decentralized storage will not be a winner-takes-all game. With differences among the major decentralized storage projects, we’ll compare them across three different points: <span class="em">the strategy they are taking, the blockchain design, and media streaming solutions.</span></p>
      <p> ​The following comparison chart is an excerpt from the article <a class="italic" href="https://medium.com/@ppio/differences-between-ppio-filecoin-storj-20cdf7b3b02e" target="_blank">The Ultimate Guide To Understanding The Differences Between PPIO, Filecoin, and Storj</a>. </p>
      <h2 class="title">&lt;Strategy></h2>
      <p>Different teams have their own approaches and strategies which may attract different application developers. For example, a VOD App developer may prefer building a project on a data distribution blockchain rather than a data storage blockchain. It is too early to judge which project has the best strategy. But certainly, when developers choose the storage to build their Apps and DApps, they'll take the projects' strategy into consideration.</p>

      <h2 class="title">&lt;Blockchain and Economy Incentive></h2>
      <p>Building on the blockchain ensures that your data is decentralized and only belongs to you. It also provides an incentive for your data to be stored. With plans to be used worldwide, a main-chain plus multiple contract chains will be deployed to ensure flexibility for future expansion and to comply with different regions’s rules.</p>

      <h2 class="title">&lt;Storage and Streaming Solutions></h2>
      <p>Media streaming has been a fixture for the web and will remain so for some time. Current data storage platforms handle music and video streaming fairly well, but with VR and game streaming on the way, we need greater storage for these future media. Decentralized storage is one of the possible solutions.</p>
